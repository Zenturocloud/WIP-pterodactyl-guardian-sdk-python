## Overview

Pterodactyl Guardian is an advanced security solution that leverages AI-driven analysis to protect your Pterodactyl Panel installation from security threats, abuse, and malicious activities. The system continuously learns from your environment and admin feedback to provide increasingly accurate protection tailored to your specific deployment.

Unlike traditional security tools that rely on static rules, Pterodactyl Guardian employs intelligent pattern recognition, code analysis, and behavioral prediction to identify threats even as they evolve and adapt.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Learning System**: Learns from admin feedback to reduce false positives
- **Contextual Awareness**: Understands your environment and adapts accordingly
- **Advanced Code Analysis**: Goes beyond pattern matching with structural understanding
- **Behavioral Prediction**: Simulates what suspicious code would do if executed
- **Signal Correlation**: Connects multiple indicators to identify sophisticated threats

### üîç Comprehensive Detection
- **Bot & Automation Detection**: Identifies automation tools across major platforms
- **Network Abuse Protection**: Detects port scanning, DDoS attempts, and more
- **Resource Abuse Prevention**: Guards against crypto miners and resource exhaustion
- **Spam & Mass Communication Filtering**: Blocks mass messaging and spam attempts

- **File System Monitoring**: Detects malicious file uploads and modifications
- **Resource Usage Monitoring**: Identifies abnormal resource consumption
- **Event-Based Analysis**: Responds to Pterodactyl Panel events in real-time
- **Scheduled Scanning**: Regular security audits with configurable frequency

## Installation

```bash
pip install pterodactyl-guardian
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Setup (Just Works‚Ñ¢)

```python
from pterodactyl_guardian import PterodactylGuardian

# Initialize with minimal configuration
guardian = PterodactylGuardian(
    panel_url="https://panel.yourdomain.com",
    api_key="your-pterodactyl-api-key"
)

# Start monitoring with intelligent defaults
guardian.start_monitoring()

# Wait for events
for event in guardian.events():
    if event.is_threat:
        print(f"Detected {event.threat_type} on server {event.server_name}")
        event.take_action()  # Auto-remediate based on threat type
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from pterodactyl_guardian import PterodactylGuardian, DetectionModules, AnalysisLevel

guardian = PterodactylGuardian(
    panel_url="https://panel.yourdomain.com",
    api_key="your-pterodactyl-api-key",
    
    # Enable specific modules
    enabled_modules=[
        DetectionModules.OBFUSCATION,
        DetectionModules.NETWORK,
        DetectionModules.WEB_SERVER
    ],
    
    # Configure intelligence
    analysis_level=AnalysisLevel.DEEP,  # Deepest code analysis
    learning_mode="aggressive",         # Learn quickly from feedback
    
    # System resources
    max_cpu_percent=20,                 # Cap CPU usage
    max_memory_mb=300,                  # Limit memory usage
    scan_threads=4,                     # Parallel scanning threads
    
    # Configure storage
    storage_engine="sqlite",            # Or "postgresql"
    data_retention_days=90,             # History retention
    
    # Runtime behavior
    check_interval_minutes=30,          # Scheduled check frequency
    alert_webhook="https://your-webhook.com/alerts"
)

# Register custom feedback handler
@guardian.on_detection
def handle_detection(threat):
    if admin_review(threat.details):
        threat.approve()   # False positive - system learns
    else:
        threat.quarantine() # Confirmed threat - system reinforces
```

## Core Components

### Smart Detection Engine
The heart of Pterodactyl Guardian is its intelligent detection engine that combines multiple analysis techniques:

1. **Pattern Analysis**: Baseline detection using optimized pattern matching
2. **Structural Analysis**: Understanding code structure through AST parsing
3. **Behavioral Analysis**: Predicting what code will do when executed
4. **Contextual Analysis**: Evaluating findings in the context of your environment

### Adaptive Learning System
Pterodactyl Guardian continuously improves through:

- **Feedback Processing**: Learning from admin decisions
- **Behavioral Baselining**: Establishing normal patterns
- **Pattern Evolution**: Tracking how threats change over time
- **Confidence Calibration**: Adjusting thresholds based on accuracy

### Monitoring Systems
Multiple monitoring approaches ensure comprehensive coverage:

- **Scheduled Checks**: Regular security auditing
- **Event Monitoring**: Real-time response to panel events
- **File System Monitoring**: Detecting new or changed files
- **Resource Monitoring**: Identifying abnormal resource usage
